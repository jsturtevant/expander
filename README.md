Expander
========

A chrome extension to expand keywords into full words quickly.
------

This application allows users to create their own shortcut key that will expand a given keyword into full text.  Similar to creating keyword shortcuts on the iPhone or in Word.  Useful in composing emails, text editors, or filling out forms online.

Examples:
-'ur' expands to 'your'
-'jjb' expands to 'jimmy joe bob'

In Beta - more features coming soon. Please leave feedback or email feature requests.

To use:
1. Open the option page.
2. Set the keyboard short that will expand the keyword.
3. Set the keyword and the full text.
4. Click Save.
5. In any text box type your key word then use the keyboard shortcut to expand to the full text.
